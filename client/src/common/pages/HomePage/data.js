          "The Logitech G402 Hyperion Fury is getting on a little now, but that means it's perfectly primed to offer a budget alternative to the latest releases. Where some of the best gaming mouse models can easily carry three-figure price tags, the Hyperion Fury is regularly available for around $35 / £35 these days. With a $49.99 / £49.99 MSRP, this was always a cheap gaming mouse. However, as tech gets more affordable over the years we often see features previously reserved for top-tier pointers making their way to these budget prices. To see just how the G402 fares against 2022's low-cost options, though, we put the 2014 release to the test over the course of two weeks.",

          "The Logitech G402 Hyperion Fury is getting on a little now, but that means it's perfectly primed to offer a budget alternative to the latest releases. Where some of the best gaming mouse models can easily carry three-figure price tags, the Hyperion Fury is regularly available for around $35 / £35 these days. With a $49.99 / £49.99 MSRP, this was always a cheap gaming mouse. However, as tech gets more affordable over the years we often see features previously reserved for top-tier pointers making their way to these budget prices. To see just how the G402 fares against 2022's low-cost options, though, we put the 2014 release to the test over the course of two weeks.",
